# SHARE DIARY

This is is a Rails application to allow you to keep a share trading diary.

## Why Would You Need A Share Diary?

When you trade shares, you are making decisions based on what YOU think the market or the share of a company will do. Consider the example below:
There is a press release from a company you are interested in that says they are confident of significant synergies in the next 12 months from their recent acquisition. You place a buy order and feel quietly confident about your decision. Two weeks later though when the share is down 20%, you are kicking yourself for your decision. With a share diary you can go back and review the reason for your decision. You can critique your decision making process and you can LEARN from the process.

> "Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.”
― Søren Kierkegaard

## The Way It Works

You create a user account.

Once logged in, you create a watchlist. You then populate your watch list with shares you would like to track.

Separately, as you read financial information of interest, you enter notes in your share diary. You associate these notes to particular shares.

The notes automatically link to shares in your watchlist.

If you want to stop following a stock, remove them from your watchlist. If you start following a stock and add them to your watchlist, any notes made in the past about that stock get automatically added.

On the day you trade (either BUY or SELL), make sure to put a note in your share diary. That way you can always go back to it later to review your decision making process.
